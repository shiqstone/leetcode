43. Multiply Strings
---
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represent as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represent as string.

Example 1:
```
Input: num1="2", num2="3"
Output: "6"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: num1="123", num2="456"
Output: "56088"
```

Note:
1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is <110
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contain only digit `0-9`
3. Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except number 0 itself
4. You must not use any build-in Biginteger library or conver the inputs to integer directly
