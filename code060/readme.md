60. Permutation Sequence
---
The set [1, 2, 3,...,n] contain a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n=3:
1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"
Given n and k, return the k<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

Note:
- Given n will between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given k wiil between 1 and n! inclusive.

Example 1:
```
Input n=3 k=3
Ouput "213"
```

Example 2:
```
Input n=4 k=9
Output "2314"
```
