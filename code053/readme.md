53. Maximum Subarray
---
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (contain at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum

Example
```
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6
Explaination: [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6
```

If you have figure out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach which is more subtle.
