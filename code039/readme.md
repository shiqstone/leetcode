39. Combination Sum
---
Given a **set** of candidate numbers(`candidates`) (without duplicates) and a large number(`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

The **same** repeated number may be choosen from `candidates` unlimited number of times.

Note:
- All numbers (include `target`) will be positive integer.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combination.

Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
    [7],
    [2, 2, 3]
]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2, 3, 5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
    [2, 2, 2, 2],
    [2, 3, 3],
    [3, 5]
]
```
